In the previous tutorial we created a work queue. The assumption behind a work queue is that each
task is delivered to exactly one worker. In this part we'll do something completely different -- we'll
deliver a message to multiple consumers. This pattern is known as "publish/subscribe".
To illustrate the pattern, we're going to build a simple logging system. It will consist of two programs --
the first will emit log messages and the second will receive and print them.
In our logging system every running copy of the receiver program will get the messages. That way
we'll be able to run one receiver and direct the logs to disk; and at the same time we'll be able to run
another receiver and see the logs on the screen.
Essentially, published log messages are going to be broadcast to all the receivers.
